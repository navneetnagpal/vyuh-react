## Hi there! üëã

**Vyuh for React** brings the powerful architecture of the Vyuh Flutter
framework to the React ecosystem. It provides a comprehensive solution for
building CMS-driven React applications with a focus on modularity, scalability,
and developer experience.

Building on the success of Vyuh for Flutter, this React implementation gives
**no-code** flexibility to Business teams (via the CMS), and the **full-code**
power to Engineering teams. This puts the right control at the right place
without any compromise.

## ü§î Why did we build this?

A common problem when building large scale applications is the _need to stay
modular_ as you keep growing the feature set. You also want different teams to
_work in parallel_ without stepping on each other. The typical approach of
creating a single project and building all the functionality in it does not
scale very well over time.

Additionally, modern web applications are very content-oriented and need to be
dynamic. This means your journeys, page content, themes, etc. should be remotely
controllable. In other words, making your app _Server-driven_.

### Separation of Concerns

Combining all these capabilities requires a holistic approach, which is only
possible when you build a cohesive framework.

> **Vyuh** is that framework.
>
> It allows you to create the perfect balance of simple, modular components on
> the `CMS`, with powerful `React` counterparts that take care of all the
> complexity.

The teams (Business teams) managing the content and experience don't have to
worry about UI Design, pixel precision or performance and focus more on
_building the screen journeys and page content_ instead. The React engineering
teams handle the complexity of the components along with its performance.

This clear separation allows a phenomenal flexibility in building simple to
large scale apps. It also gives _the right tools to the right teams_ and makes
them more productive.

## The Framework

The **Vyuh for React** framework has some powerful built-in capabilities such
as:

- [x] Building features atomically and in a modular fashion
- [x] Features as transferable and reusable units of functionality
- [x] Remote configuration of content, enabling Server-Driven UI
- [x] Extensible Plugin-based approach to add new third-party integrations
- [x] Team Independence
- [x] Decentralised development
- [x] Creating a family of apps with reusable features
- [x] A growing set of integrations to make app development faster

## üî© The Building Blocks

The core building blocks that enable all of this include:

- **Features**: Build user-facing functionality in a modular, reusable, atomic
  manner. Features can be composed together to create the entire app or a family
  of apps.

- **Plugins**: All third party integrations are handled in a cross-cutting
  manner using Plugins. Authentication, Networking, CMS, Storage, Permissions,
  etc. are all plugins that are available to all features.

- **CMS-Driven UI**: Also known as Server-Driven UI, the entire app experience
  can be driven from a CMS. This includes the screen journeys, page content,
  themes, etc. The CMS itself is a standard plugin with custom Providers.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The default CMS we use is [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io).

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Basic Setup

```tsx
import { VyuhProvider, PluginDescriptor } from '@vyuh/react-core';
import { DefaultContentPlugin } from '@vyuh/react-extension-content';
import { SanityContentProvider } from '@vyuh/react-plugin-content-provider-sanity';
import { feature as systemFeature } from '@vyuh/react-feature-system';

// Configure your content provider
const contentProvider = new SanityContentProvider({
  projectId: 'your-project-id',
  dataset: 'production',
  perspective: 'published',
  useCdn: true,
});

// Configure plugins
const plugins = new PluginDescriptor({
  content: new DefaultContentPlugin(contentProvider),
});

// Define your features
const getFeatures = () => [
  systemFeature,
  // Your custom features
];

// Set up your application
function App() {
  return (
    <VyuhProvider features={getFeatures} plugins={plugins}>
      <YourApp />
    </VyuhProvider>
  );
}
```

### Using the Vyuh Hook

```tsx
import { useVyuh } from '@vyuh/react-core';

function MyComponent() {
  const { features, plugins } = useVyuh();

  // Access content plugin
  const contentPlugin = plugins.content;

  // Render content
  return (
    <div>
      {contentPlugin.render({
        _type: 'myContentType',
        title: 'Hello World',
        // ...other content properties
      })}
    </div>
  );
}
```
